**1. Main Topic or Theme:** The story centers on the theme of selfless love and sacrifice, particularly within the context of Christmas and material poverty.  It explores the irony of giving and receiving gifts, highlighting the true meaning of love over material wealth.


**2. Key Supporting Points/Arguments:**

* **Extreme Poverty:** Della and Jim are incredibly poor, living in a cramped apartment and struggling to make ends meet.  This financial hardship underscores the depth of their sacrifice.
* **Sacrifice of Valued Possessions:**  Della sells her beautiful, prized hair to buy Jim a platinum fob chain for his heirloom watch. Jim, in turn, sells his watch to buy Della a set of combs she's admired.  Both sacrifice their most cherished possessions for the other.
* **Irony of the Gifts:**  The irony lies in the fact that both gifts become unusable due to the other's sacrifice.  Della's beautiful hair is gone, rendering the combs useless, and Jim's watch is sold, making the chain pointless.
* **The True Meaning of Christmas:** The story ultimately suggests that the true spirit of Christmas, and of giving, lies not in the material value of the gifts but in the love and selflessness behind the act.


**3. Overall Conclusion or Message:** The story concludes that Della and Jim, despite their poverty and the ironic outcome of their gift exchange, are the wisest givers because their love and sacrifice transcend material possessions.  Their actions exemplify the true meaning of Christmas â€“ the selfless act of giving and loving, regardless of the outcome. The final line, comparing them to the Magi, emphasizes this point, suggesting that their love and sacrifice are as valuable and wise as the gifts of the wise men to the Christ child.  The material gifts are secondary to the profound act of love and selflessness they represent.
