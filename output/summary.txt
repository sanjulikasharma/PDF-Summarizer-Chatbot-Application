**1. Main Topic/Theme:** The story centers on the theme of selfless love and sacrifice, particularly within the context of poverty and the Christmas holiday.  It explores the irony of how the greatest gifts are often those given with the most sacrifice.

**2. Key Supporting Points/Arguments:**

* **Extreme Poverty:** Della and Jim are incredibly poor, living in a cramped apartment and struggling to make ends meet.  Their limited financial resources highlight the depth of their sacrifice.
* **The Importance of Gifts:** The story emphasizes the importance of giving and receiving gifts as a symbol of love and affection, particularly during Christmas.  The act of gift-giving itself is more significant than the material value of the gift.
* **Selfless Sacrifice:** Both Della and Jim sacrifice their most prized possessions—Della's beautiful hair and Jim's heirloom watch—to buy each other Christmas gifts. This act of selfless love underscores the story's central theme.
* **Irony of the Situation:** The irony lies in the fact that both Della and Jim bought gifts that are now unusable because of the other's sacrifice.  They unwittingly bought gifts that cater to the very possessions they sacrificed.  This underscores the unintended consequences of their loving intentions.
* **The True Meaning of Christmas:** The story ultimately suggests that the true meaning of Christmas lies not in material wealth but in the love and sacrifice shared between people.

**3. Overall Conclusion/Message:** The story concludes by asserting that Della and Jim, despite their foolish actions in a material sense, are the wisest of gift-givers because their actions were driven by profound love and selflessness.  Their sacrifice transcends the material value of their gifts, highlighting the true spirit of generosity and the immeasurable value of love. The final comparison to the Magi underscores this point, suggesting that the greatest gifts come from the heart, not the wallet.
